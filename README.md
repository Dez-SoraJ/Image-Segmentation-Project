#X-Ray Crack Detection — A Visual Interface for Fracture Insight

Unveiling the silent fissures within industrial materials or skeletal structures demands more than mere visual inspection. This application harmonizes computer vision algorithms with an intuitive graphical interface to discern and illustrate cracks from X-ray images with precision and artistry.

**Requisites for Incantation**

##Functionality##

Grayscale Conversion — Drowns the image in monochrome for sharper abstraction.

CLAHE Enhancement — Breathes contrast into the grayscale void for deeper clarity.

Gaussian Blurring — Mutes noise that whispers false positives.

Canny Edge Detection — Etches the boundaries of truth using algorithmic ink.

Morphological Closing — Seals stray lines into unified cracks.

Contour Weaving — Outlines every suspect crevice using iterative scrutiny.

Shape Filtering — Employs aspect ratio and arc length metrics to discard the mundane.
